# TDAview

TDAview is a visualisation tool for topological data analysis, focusing on:
  - Ease of use
  - Compatibility with R workflows
  - Efficient display of large force networks in WebGL
  - Control over node and edge formatting
  - Publishing results
TDAview be used either as (a) visualisation tool, by importing a Mapper object generated using the TDAmapper R package [1] or (b) an analysis and visualization tool, by importing the data and metadata, and choosing the Mapper parameters. For this option, TDAview implements the TDAmapper algorithm in JavaScript.
